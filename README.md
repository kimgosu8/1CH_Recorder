1CH Recorder
======

This code is a sample DVR example (own filesystem) made a long time(15 years) ago. 
This is a DVR example made only with SW like FFMPEG so that ordinary people such as PCs, camcorders, and graphics cards can follow it without HW codecs at the time.
I hope it will be helpful to students studying file system and video.
